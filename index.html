  <p>“We're all going to die, all of us, what a circus! That alone should make us love each other but it doesn't. We are terrorized and flattened by trivialities, we are eaten up by nothing.”
    ― Charles Bukowski</p>
  <p>“Pain and suffering are always inevitable for a large intelligence and a deep heart. The really great men must, I think, have great sadness on earth.”
    ― Fyodor Dostoevsky</p>
  <p>“The individual has always had to struggle to keep from being overwhelmed by the tribe. If you try it, you will be lonely often, and sometimes frightened. But no price is too high to pay for the privilege of owning yourself.”
    ― Friedrich Nietzsche</p>
  <p>“Man was born free, and he is everywhere in chains. Those who think themselves the masters of others are indeed greater slaves than they.”
    ― Jean-Jacques Rousseau</p>
  <p>“No power can rule this head, who is ready to be separated from its body in the name of freedom and the good of all humanity.”
    — Hristo Botev</p>
